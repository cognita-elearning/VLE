-- SUMMARY --

This module provides Moodle SCORM (http://www.moodle.org) integration for Drupal using CCK functionality. It depends on the CCK and the FileField module. This first version focuses on displaying SCORM contents and logging events for each user. Analysis of all logged events will be part of a later release. The module enables the user to upload a SCORM compatible Zip file during node creation process. The user can decide if the SCORM content should be opened in a new window or if it should be embedded (width and height parameters are available).

The module is developed during the project “E-Learning 2.0 in craftsmanship trainings” funded by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (http://www.bmbf.de/) and the European Social Fund (http://www.esf.de/). Project maintainer is the German Center for Aerospace (http://www.dlr.de/). The module is developed by Servit Open Source Solutions (www.servit.ch) and is adjusted by the project team (http://q-online.de/kontakt). The module is a part of the community portal which is currently in development.
